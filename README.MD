- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SimonDaKappa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Optimization, Numerical Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and whatever the breeze brings.
- ðŸŒ± I graduated with a B.S. Dual in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a focus in Operations Research and A.I

My **Current Projects** 
- A full-stack rewrite of NeRF-Or-Nothing; A micro-service Deep Learning powered 3D video reconstruction application.
- A distributed key-value BSON store with RESTful api access written in Elixir.

I've been coding for 4 years, trying to expose myself to as many technologies as possible. I've recently started to track all my progress, so see
