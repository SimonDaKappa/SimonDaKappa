- 👋 Hi, I’m @SimonDaKappa
- 🧑‍💼 I currently work at Emerson!
- 👀 I’m interested in Optimization, Full Stack Development, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Embedded Software, and whatever the breeze brings.
- 🌱 I graduated with a B.S. Dual in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a focus in Operations Research and A.I

My **Current Projects** 
- A full-stack rewrite of NeRF-Or-Nothing; A micro-service Deep Learning powered 3D video reconstruction application.
- A full-stack RAG Chatbot, with Knowledge Graph / Embedding Community Optimization, Custom MCP tools, and CI/CD pipeline integration.
  - (This one is private, sorry)
- **go-pave**: A universal parsing and validation libray
- **go-umami**: A univseral metrics abstraction designed to abstract away integrations with common metrics providers in go.
I've been developing for 5 years, while trying to expose myself to as many technologies as possible. I've recently started to track all my progress, so see
